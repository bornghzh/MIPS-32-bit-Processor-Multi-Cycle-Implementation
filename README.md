# MIPS 32-bit Processor - Multi-Cycle Implementation

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit MIPS processor using a multi-cycle architecture. The design aims to execute each instruction over multiple clock cycles, providing a more detailed understanding of MIPS architecture and optimizing resource usage.

## Features

- Multi-Cycle Execution: Each instruction is executed over multiple clock cycles.
- 32-bit Data Path: Supports 32-bit wide instructions and data.
- MIPS Instruction Set: Implements a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
- Modular Design: Composed of separate modules for ALU, control unit, register file, and memory.
